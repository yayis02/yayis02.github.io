### CPSC 120


* LAB 07 Reflection
For this lab, we only had one part to it, which was the parking rules. 
What I enjoyed the most about this lab was the functions we had to make for 
each street sign. The important aspect that I found from this lab was how we had to 
provide a different argument for each independent variable. 

* LAB 09 Reflection
This lab was our first introduction to files and how we can write in them. For part one of this lab, what we handled was utilizing a dictionary already provided by one of the .cc files within the repository. 
What I found the most interesting feature, which has since been used for other labs,
is the push back, essentially adding items to a vector.
As for part 2, it fell under the same category as part 1, 
with the addition of ifstream and ofstream. 
This is where I learned how one can type information to get it submitted to a file,
 which then can be displayed.

* LAB 04 Reflection
In lab 04, we were tasked with two parts. 
The contents contained in part one dealt with creating and converting measurements 
to other measurements. Here is where I delved into conversion, specifically dealing 
with doubles. As for part two of the lab, what was considered to be the most 
memorable from the code was the if / else loops, it gave me a better 
understanding of how each condition works and what happens when
it doesnt work.
